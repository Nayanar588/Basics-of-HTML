    <h2><i><u> ABOUT FOREST </u></i></h2>
    <h3><q>Forest, complex ecological system and natural resource in which trees are the dominant life-form.</q></h3>

    <p>Forests can occur wherever the temperatures rise above 10 째C (50 째F) in the warmest months and the annual precipitation is more than 200 mm (8 inches). <br>They can develop under a variety of conditions within these climatic limits, and the kind of soil, plant, and animal life differs according to the extremes of environmental influences.</p><hr>

    <p>In cool high-latitude subpolar regions, forests are dominated by hardy conifers such as pines (Pinus), spruces (Picea), and larches (Larix). <hr>In the Northern Hemisphere, these forests, called taiga, or boreal forests, have prolonged winters and between 250 and 500 mm (10 and 20 inches) of rainfall annually. <br>Coniferous forests also cover mountains in many temperate parts of the world.</p><hr>

    <p>In more temperate <strike>high-latitude climates</strike>, mixed forests of both conifers and broad-leaved deciduous trees predominate. <br>Broad-leaved deciduous forests develop in <del>middle-latitude</del> climates, where there is an average temperature above 10 째C (50 째F) for at least six months every year and annual precipitation is above 400 mm (16 inches). <br>A growing period of 100 to 200 days allows deciduous forests to be dominated by oaks (Quercus), elms (Ulmus), birches (Betula), maples (Acer), beeches (Fagus), and aspens (Populus).</p><hr>
        
    <p>In the humid climates of the equatorial belt are <small>tropical rainforests</small>, which support incredible plant and animal biodiversity. <br>There heavy rainfall supports evergreens that have broad leaves instead of needle leaves, as in cooler forests.<br> Monsoon forests, which are the deciduous forests of tropical areas, are found in regions with a long dry season followed by an intense rainy season. </p><hr>

    <pre>When I was One,
        I had just begun.
        When I was Two,
        I was nearly new.
        When I was Three
        I was hardly me.
        When I was Four,
        I was not much more.
        When I was Five,
        I was just alive.
        But now I am Six,
        I'm as clever as clever,
        So I think I'll be six now for ever and ever.</pre><hr>
