    <h1> <i> <u>FLOWERS </u></i> </h1>

    <p><h3><q>Flowers are the reproductive part of flowering plants. They produce seeds, which eventually become other flowers. 
        The primary purpose of a flower is reproduction.</q></h3></p>

        <p>In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant <b>flowers</b>, 
            is flowering or is in flower when this <strong>colourful</strong> part begins to grow bigger and open out. </p>
         <p>There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. 
            Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.</p>

       <p><h3> Flowers are made up of four whorls:- </h3>

       <p><b><u>Calyx and corolla</b></u>: The two outer whorls.</p>
       <p><b><u>Androecium</b></u>       : The male part of the flower.</p>
       <p><b><u>Gynoecium</b></u>        : The female part of the flower.</p>

    <p><h4><i>There are so many different species of flowers in the world no one knows an exact number, 
        but the closest estimate is somewhere between 250,000 and 400,000 species.</h4></i>
